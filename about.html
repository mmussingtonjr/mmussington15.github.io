        <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
    I am <strong>Marlon Mussington</strong>, and I am a second-year student at the <a href="https://www.uri.edu/">University of Rhode Island</a>. <br>
I am currently an undeclared student that is exploring the computer science major. I am originally from North Kingstown, RI,<br>
so I am an in-state student. I have a huge passion of gaming, music, and tech, so I felt like computer science was a great fit for me.<br>
I also feel that I have an analytical brain, so programming will be something that's up my alley.
